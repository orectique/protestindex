## Annual Protest Index

This is the back repository for the [Unrest Evaluation Index (UEI) Project](https://unrest-index.herokuapp.com/). UEI is a novel way to compare the intensity of protests across timeframes and locations. The interactive graph at [https://unrest-index.herokuapp.com/](https://unrest-index.herokuapp.com/) allows one to compare country-years of protests.

### How to use

Upon initialization, the graph displays the country-year values for a caountry randomly selected from the list of available countries.

1. Select the relevant countries from the dropdown menu on the bottom - left of the page.
2. Use the range slider below the graph output to select the range of years.
